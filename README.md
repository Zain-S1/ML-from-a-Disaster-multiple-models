# Investigating the Titanic - Machine Learning from a Disaster
In this project, I dived deep into the tragic sinking of the Titanic, using machine learning to analyze passenger data and predict survival outcomes.
I explored key factors that influenced survival, such as age, gender, and social class, and built predictive models to understand the impact of these factors.   

## Key Steps and Highlights
1. **Data Exploration**: Here I delved into the Titanic dataset, exploring passenger demographics, travel class, and other relevant information.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Where I cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, handling missing values, and transforming features for optimal model performance.
3. **Feature Engineering**: By identifying and extracting the most influential factors contributing to survival.
4. **Model Building**: I built and evaluated various machine learning models, including **Decision Trees**, **Gaussian Naïve Bayes**, and **Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)** to predict passenger survival.
